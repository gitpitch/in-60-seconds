“**Write the Docs** is a global community of people who care about documentation.

The Write the Docs conference includes Writing Day, traditional conference-style talks, an Unconference, and a job fair.”

## What's Writing Day?

“This event is to get a bunch of interesting people in a room together and have them work towards shared goals.”

The vibe was like a Fixit Day.
