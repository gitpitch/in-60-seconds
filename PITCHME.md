# Github the industry standard

## What is Git
### Git (/ɡɪt/) is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.
### It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. 
### Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.[12] Its current maintainer since 2005 is Junio Hamano. As with most other distributed version-control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server.[13] Git is free and open-source software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2.
